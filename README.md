# Data-Analysis-and-Statistical-Testing-for-Research-Tools
### Overview
This repository contains my work for the **Continuous Assessment Exercise (CAE 2)** in the **Research Tools and Technology Transfer Management** course (M0.201). The project focuses on applying statistical analysis methods to solve real-world data analysis problems using Python. The exercises in this project include confidence interval calculation, hypothesis testing, ANOVA, and linear regression, and are all implemented in a Jupyter Notebook for clear documentation and analysis.

### Objectives
- Apply statistical analysis techniques to different datasets using Python.
- Perform hypothesis testing to validate assumptions about data distributions.
- Implement data analysis tasks such as confidence interval estimation, non-parametric testing, ANOVA, and linear regression.
- Document findings and present results in a clear, structured format using a Jupyter Notebook.

### Exercises

#### Exercise 1: Confidence Interval & χ² Test
- **Goal**: Generate a random sample, calculate a 90% confidence interval, and perform a χ² test to determine if the data follows a normal or Poisson distribution.

#### Exercise 2: Non-Parametric Test
- **Goal**: Use a non-parametric test to check if the given samples belong to the same population.

#### Exercise 3: ANOVA Test
- **Goal**: Perform ANOVA to determine if the samples are independent, both manually and using Python.

#### Exercise 4: Linear Regression
- **Goal**: Assess the linear relationship between X and Y values and evaluate the quality of the linear fit.

### Tools and Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary language for statistical analysis.
  - Libraries used: `numpy`, `scipy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `statsmodels`
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For documenting and running code, ensuring clarity and reproducibility of results.

### Deliverables
- **Jupyter Notebook**: A well-structured notebook (`.ipynb`) containing all code, analysis, results, and visualizations.
  - The notebook will include clear explanations, properly commented code, and visual aids (graphs, tables) to support the analysis.

Thank you for reviewing my work on **Data Analysis and Statistical Testing for Research Tools**!
